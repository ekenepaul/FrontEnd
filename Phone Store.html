(1) Samsung Galaxy A53 </h4>
    <!-- This phone is tailor made for high-end users -->

    <p> Samsung has been maintaining a particularly strong Galaxy A series of devices for some time now. It has been iterating and improving its value proposition on these phones, and the new 2022 refresh is no different.</p>
    <p>  You can read all about the new Galaxy A73 5G, A53 5G and A33 5G here to see exactly what we mean. </p>
    <p> The new Galaxy A53 5G is now here for review. Since the 5X series has arguably been one of the better-geared devices in the series, it is also the toughest one to upgrade. 
    <p> In comparison, this year's Galaxy A33 5G is a much lower hanging fruit seeing how its predecessor came with an LCD.</p>
    <p> Changes going from the A52s 5G to the A53 5G are a lot more subtle. Simply put, not much has changed, certainly not enough to entice current owners of a recent Galaxy A5X series phone, but there are still some noteworthy changes here and there.</p>
    <p> First up - the straight-up positive change - the A53 5G has a larger 5,000mAh battery than its predecessor. There is also a brand new chipset made by Samsung - the Exynos 1280. A modern 5nm part, still not officially present or detailed on Samsung's semiconductor website, but very much already in the wild and looking intriguing with a 2x2.4 GHz Cortex-A78 & 6x2.0 GHz Cortex-A55 CPU configuration, a Mali-G68 GPU and arguably even more versatile 5G setup than the Snapdragon 778G 5G inside the A52s 5G.

    On the flip side, there are some notable downgrades in the A53 5G as well. For one, it lacks the 3.5mm audio jack of its predecessor. It is also missing Wi-Fi 6 support. Though, it does offer slightly newer Bluetooth 5.1.
    
    Other than this, the A53 5G is pretty much identical both in terms of specs and design to its predecessor. Even though, technically, it has shrunk down some in physical size, all the while keeping its display diagonal and weight unchanged. So, you are essentially getting smaller display bezels and a larger battery for "free". Not counting the 3.5mm jack, that is.</p>

(2) Google Pixel </h4>
    <!-- this phone is useless as it has a low market share -->
    <P> It was a fairly unexciting conclusion. When I reviewed the Google Pixel 7 Pro last year, I walked away with the impression of a phone that was a bit better in some important ways but wasn’t quite the superintelligent, time-saving device that Google claimed it was. It was just a good smartphone, not a smarter smartphone.

    But that was over six months ago, and one of Google selling points for its Pixel line is how its devices continue to gain features and smarts over time. Then there are things like Direct My Call — a feature that transcribes automated phone tree menu options — which get better as more people use them, so they’re not always at peak potential right at launch.
    
    For all of these reasons, I thought it was worth revisiting the Pixel 7 Pro in between the regularly scheduled programming of Hot Foldable Summer. What I’ve found — and I’m sorry to disappoint with another predictable conclusion — is a little more of the same. Some things got a bit better, but for the most part, the things I liked about the Pixel 7 Pro the first time around are the things I like now.</P>

    <p> Thinking that there might not be enough Pixel owners calling Bartell pharmacy regularly, I tried Walgreens and ran into a different problem: a robot. Rather than present you with a list of options to choose from, Walgreens does that cute thing where it asks, “In a few words, tell me how I can help,” or something to that effect. The Pixel 7 Pro is no help here, at least not now. I’m sure in the future, our phones will employ robots to talk to the other robots for you, which is truly the dream — robots all the way down and all — but at the moment, I still have to yell “talk to the pharmacist” into my phone without the benefit of special tech features.

    Then there is the spam. The Pixel 7 Pro is good at detecting and blocking spam calls, but not so much for texts. While testing the phone again, a couple of scam texts with fake Instagram password reset requests made it through unscathed. They were convincing enough that I questioned for a second whether someone was trying to access my Instagram account, but as best I can tell, that wasn’t the case. In that instance, all I needed was a good old-fashioned instinct to never trust anyone calling or texting me from an unusual number — not a fancy spam-detecting feature.</p>

(3) iPhone 14 </h4> 
    <!-- this phone carries the price tag of a land in the village -->
    <p> The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth and latest generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, and were announced during Apple Event, Apple Park in Cupertino, California, on September 7, 2022, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagships. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a 6.1-inch (15 cm) and 6.7-inch (17 cm) display, improvements to the rear-facing camera, and satellite connectivity for contacting emergency services when a user in trouble is beyond the range of Wi-Fi or cellular networks.[10][11] The iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022,[12] and iPhone 14 Plus was made available on October 7, 2022, priced at $799 and $899 respectively and was launched with iOS 16.[7][13] Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus began on September 9, 2022.[14]

    The iPhone 14 does not have a "Mini" version like its predecessor, the iPhone 13 Mini. Instead, Apple has reintroduced a larger dimension iPhone 14 named the iPhone 14 Plus. Apple has not introduced a Plus model iPhone since the iPhone 8 Plus in 2017. iPhone 14 and 14 Plus models (as well as iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models) sold in the United States drop support for physical SIM cards, making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4 to not come with a discrete SIM card reader</p>

(9) Sony Xperia </p> </h4>
    <!-- this phone too was used by guys and girls that loved shinny objects-->
    <p>     The Xperia X1 was the first phone to be released in the Xperia range. Released in 2008, it featured a high resolution display (~311 ppi pixel density) and it was intended to fill the widening gap of smartphones as other competitors were producing high-end smartphone devices such as HTC and Apple.
        The X2 was released in the following year, which included an 8.1 MP camera and included Wifi and GPS. By this time there was a clear shift towards the smartphone end of the spectrum. An exception was the Xperia Pureness, a translucent phone without camera that was sold by selected retailers in selected cities. The Xperia X5 Pureness is based on Sony Ericsson's proprietary operating system (OSE).
        The X10 was released at the start of 2010. It was the first in the Xperia line to feature the Android operating system, where previous models ran on the Windows Mobile OS. The phone was praised on its design, but its downfall was its use of Android 1.6 at a time when competitors were on 2.1. There was a great delay in the update of the firmware, due to the heavily skinned OS, as well as Timescape and Mediascape which needed to be reprogrammed every time an update was made. The phone also lacked pinch to zoom, but this was added later as well as HD video recording.
        The X10 Mini and the X10 Mini Pro were, as the names suggest, smaller versions of the X10. These were received relatively well and proved to be very popular, as there were no other smartphones on the market at that time which were as small as the two.
        The Z series smartphones continued the Xperia legacy with an omni-balance design and water resistance. On several Sony Xperia smartphones such as the Xperia Z, the charging port is located at the top of the left edge, rather than popularly at the bottom center.
        The Xperia Z is the earliest known device to feature high dynamic range filming, and does it at 1080p. Its image sensor is an Exmor IMX135.
        After the Sony Xperia Z (early 2013), the Z1 (late 2013) was released with increased processing performance and a physical shutter button, as well as augmented reality camera effects such as a walking dinosaur.
        In early 2014, the Sony Xperia Z2 was introduced with 2160p video recording, 1080p at 60 frames per second, and 720p at 120fps for slow motion, as well as precluded screencasting functionality.
        In 2016, Sony introduced the new Xperia X series to replace the Z series and in 2018, Sony introduced the Sony Xperia XZ2 along with the Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact at Mobile World Congress 2018 featuring Sony's brand new "Ambient Flow" smartphone design while the premium smartphone, the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium featuring a 4K HDR Display and a 19 MP + 12 MP MotionEye Dual camera built for 'extreme' low-light shooting was announced two months later.
        Sony has been criticized for the heavily inconsistent naming of their Xperia devices.

(10) Motorola </h4>
    <!-- i loved the razor version that year. It was a status thing back in that day -->
    <p> Codenamed Siliqua, the original RAZR series of flip phones was part of the 4LTR line. Development of the V3 started in July 2003 with Motorola aiming to create a very skinny phone. It was announced on July 27, 2004 and released in the market in late 2004.

    The team of the V3 put together a number of design choices that set the device apart from the competition. The phone had the thinnest profile at the time on a clamshell set, sported an electroluminescent keypad made out of a single metal wafer and used an industry-standard mini-USB port for data, battery charger and headphones, housed in an aluminum body with an external glass screen.
            
    A black version was produced for distribution in the 77th Academy Awards gift bags, was released in early May 2005. While distribution was initially limited to specific carriers in North America, the black V3 was widely available elsewhere.
    The first pink version was released in October 2005, and as of June 2006, was available in the United States from T-Mobile as the Razr V3 Magenta (after T-Mobile and its parent Deutsche Telekom's corporate color). It was called the Razr V3 Pink and available on other carriers, including on T-Mobile networks in other countries in addition to Verizon, Cingular Wireless, Suncom Wireless, and Cellular One (each in a different shade). It was also available in Canada from Bell, Rogers Wireless and Telus, and in the United Kingdom from T-Mobile and Carphone Warehouse. $25 of sales from the Rogers-branded pink V3 went to Rethink Breast Cancer. It was also available in all Movistar-serviced countries and Claro (Telcel).
            
    Because of its unique appearance and thin profile, it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone. However, within a year, its price was lowered and as a result, Motorola reported sales had reached 50 million in July 2006. Leading up to the release, Motorola's cell phone division sales were stagnant and losing money. The success of the Razr made the division profitable again. Around the time of the V3's launch, Motorola had overtaken Nokia to become market leader in North America, and it also recovered back from falling to third place worldwide behind Samsung during the third quarter.
    Over the Razr's four-year run, it sold more than 130 million units, becoming the best-selling clamshell phone in the world to date. Despite its success, Motorola's overliance on the Razr contributed to the company eventually running out of steam; while the Razr V3 was fashionable, Motorola kept using almost the same design in newer models, which was criticised in comparison to LG which after its Chocolate diversified into fresh designed fashionable phones rather than recycling the old. Motorola's market share dropped sharply in 2007 and the company posted a loss.
