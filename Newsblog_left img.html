            <h3>
                Shehu Sani, a socio-political commentator, on Tuesday, said there is
                high possibility the newly-inaugurated Minister of Federal Capital
                Territory, FCT, Nyesom Wike, will get himself into “serious political
                trouble” with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. He said while there is no
                doubt about Wike’s capability to deliver on his job, there is also
                tendency that he may land in trouble with the president “by his
                utterances or actions.” The former Kaduna Central Senator said Wike must
                learn how to “walk in a minefield or be blown by it.”

        <h3>
          The National Assembly Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Umuahia, the
          Abia State capital, has dismissed a petition challenging the election of
          the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Chief Benjamin Kalu,
          for lacking in merit. While delivering judgement on the matter on
          Tuesday, the three-man panel led by Justice Sampson Gane, ruled that it
          was the right of the first respondent to change his name as no person or
          group of persons has the monopoly of any name. He ruled that Kalu
          equally harmonised the names in his certificate with a deed poll which
          was published in the Federal Government’s official gazette. The judge
          ruled that the onus of proofs was on the petitioner to prove that the
          certificates the respondent submitted to INEC did not belong to him, but
          he abandoned his case for the respondent to prove.

        <h3>
          BRICS leaders meet in South Africa on Tuesday as the loose association
          of major emerging economies seeks to assert its voice as a counterweight
          to Western dominance in global affairs. The so-called BRICS nations —
          Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — represent a quarter of
          the global economy, and interest in joining the club has surged ahead of
          its three-day summit in Johannesburg. Security has been bolstered across
          the city where South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will host China’s
          President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Brazil’s
          President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and some 50 other leaders. Russian
          President Vladimir Putin is the target of an international arrest
          warrant over alleged war crimes in Ukraine and will not attend in
          person, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov sent on his behalf. Xi,
          whose country is the most powerful BRICS member, met with Ramaphosa
          ahead of the summit on just his second international trip of the year.
          “Now as friends and BRICS partners, we stand together in our shared
          objective and quest for a better and more egalitarian world that frees
          the potential of all the people in the world,” said Ramaphosa in
          Pretoria at the opening of Xi’s state visit.

          The third evicted BBNaija All Stars housemate, Terseer Waya, aka
          Kiddwaya, is confident of reconciling with his girlfriend, Laura who
          unfollowed him on Instagram after he admitted kissing Mercy Eke shortly
          before his eviction. During one of his media rounds, Kidd explained that
          his lover unfollowed him because she doesn’t understand that his kiss
          with Mercy was just “a game.” He, however, expressed confidence that she
          would follow him back. “My relationship is going well. We are solid,
          man. In any normal relationship, there are issues here and there but I’m
          Kiddwaya, man, what can go wrong? “Don’t worry [about her unfollowing me
          on Instagram], she’s going to follow me back. I think it’s because she
          is not used to the game. Big Brother is crazy. It’s a crazy world, crazy
          platform, crazy game. And you need to understand the things you need to
          do to get ahead. So, she didn’t understand some certain things but with
          time, she will. She will come around, ” Kiddwaya said in an interview
          with The Beat 99.9 FM, Lagos.<a

          Afrobeats sensation Asake marked his return to the UK stage for the
          first time since the unfortunate incident that claimed the lives of
          Rebecca Ikumelo and Gaby Hutchinson, with a heartfelt three-minute
          tribute video. The pair tragically lost their lives in a crowd surge
          outside the O2 Academy Brixton last December. Asake's London comeback on
          Sunday evening featured a poignant performance by a skilled poet,
          dedicated to Rebecca and Gaby. The tribute video concluded with a plea
          to the public for any information related to the incident to be shared
          with the authorities. Rebecca, aged 33, and security guard Gaby, aged
          23, met their untimely demise during the crowd commotion that marred
          Asake's inaugural UK gig on December 15th. \The Metropolitan Police's
          investigation into the incident is still ongoing, and the O2 Academy
          Brixton has remained shuttered since that fateful night, as Lambeth
          Council reviews its licensing status.<a
